# Setting up Reaper

## Audio device
Reaper asks you which audio device you want to use. In case you don't use an external audio interface just leave it with the default settings. Your OS will then automatically choose the device and switches to headphones if you plug some in.

## Layout
The default layout in Reaper is already quite well designes for the purpose of classical music editing. However, the mixer won't be useful in the beginning so you can just press cmd+m and it will disappear. In case you need it, just press cmd+m again.
